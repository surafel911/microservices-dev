# microservices-dev

This repository will serve to enhance my understanding of SoA and microservices
through practical development. My practical example will be Data at the Point
of Care (https://dpc.cms.gov/). The intention isn't to be accurate to the
example, but to demonstate concepts and technologies. Therefore, the business
logic will be simplistic in favor of architectural complexity and
understanding.
